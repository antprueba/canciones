Oi, oi
On the back of the roads, man, it rains, it pours
When that happens, we load it some more (load it up)
Cleanin' the streets, we call it chores
Back of the roads, man, it rains, it pours
Trials and tribulations had me feelin' at my worst
I was stuck in the mud, I don't wanna hear your good words
Leave me alone, I'm not concerned
And neither are you
His people are filled up with venom
We call 'em snakes
Tryna eat the food out my plate
How you gonna do that?
You already ate
Pass me the bally, it's after eight
Still hug the block, fell in love with the curb
Gun powder in the air, opp blood on the floor
I have blood where I step, I don't care about Diors
I've kicked down doors and the feds kicked mine back
Call this Van Damme, have you felt the kick-back?
Uh naw, you ain't like that, just sit back
Never thought I'd be gettin' paid off of this rap
Uh, I thought I'd be on the curb servin' wraps
On the back of the roads, it rains, it pours
When that happens, we load it some more (load it up)
Cleanin' the streets, we call it chores
Back of the roads, it rains it pours
On the back of the roads, man, it rains, it pours
When that happens, we load it some more (load it up)
Cleanin' the streets, we call it chores
Back of the roads, man, it rains, it pours
I used to go around gettin' loose twice a day
Niggas wanna talk, but they don't play the game
Niggas wanna talk, but they don't act
I point where they talkin' at
Had to drop it out when I clocked it was fake
Niggas don't want ride out, niggas don't wanna be bait
They wanna talk hype, gossip, eat cake
Niggas, you ain't on it, nothin' like great
On the back of the roads, it rains, it pours
When that happens, we load it some more (load it up)
Cleanin' the streets, we call it chores
Back of the roads, it rains, it pours
On the back of the roads, man, it rains, it pours
When that happens, we load it some more (load it up)
Cleanin' the streets, we call it chores
Back of the roads, man, it rains, it pours
On the back of the roads, it rains, it pours
When that happens, we load it some more (load it up)
Cleanin' the streets, we call it chores
Back of the roads, it rains, it pours
On the back of the roads, man, it rains, it pours
When that happens, we load it some more (load it up)
Cleanin' the streets, we call it chores
Back of the roads, man, it rains, it pours
On the back of the roads, man, it rains, it pours
When that happens, we load it some more (load it up)
Cleanin' the streets, we call it chores
Back of the roads, man, it rains, it pours
